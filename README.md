# docker-gui
Run a GUI application in a docker container

The intended use case is installing applictions which require conflicting dependencies,
or applications which are not packaged for your distribution. It allows you to install
Arch packages on Ubuntu, or Ubuntu packages on CentOS, even if that means displaying a
graphical interface.
